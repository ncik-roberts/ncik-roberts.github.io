    <p>
    Hi, I'm Nick. I'm sophomore studying computer science at Carnegie Mellon University.
    I like programming things and learning about language and playing piano. This site serves no
    real purpose.

      <p>
      I wrote an equation grapher in Javascript on the educational site Khan Academy. The user can
      type in custom equations and see their graphs. The fun part of this project was the fact
      that Khan Academy disallows eval.

      <p>
      At HackCMU, I worked in a team of 4 to make this Android app. It's an icebreaker-ish sort of
      game. We used Google's <a href="https://developers.google.com/nearby/"
        title="Information about Nearby Connections API">Nearby Connections API</a> to create a local
      game server for two teams. Every player prints two UPC-A barcodes, attaching
      one to their back and one to their front. Then, tag!&mdash;and not just <em>any</em> tag, but tag
      with <em>cameras</em>&mdash;and not just <em>any</em> cameras, but the cameras on your
      <em>phones</em>.
