  Donald McMunn grew up along the Allegheny River before there were modern appliances for things like washing clothes. They raised a few cattle, kept chickens and ducks for the good eggs, and grew crops like alfalfa that they sold for a few cents a pound. They hunted for muskrat, deer, and squirrel for the meat and the skins.

  Although their home was just a few miles from Pittsburgh as the eagle flies, it could have been the olden days there. Many adults couldn't read or write, and children didn't always know too much, either. Don's family would cool their feet and wash their pots and pans in the nearby stream, despite the fact that the water had an odd yellow color because of the coal mines upstream. Down the river to the southwest, past the rusting flagpole, smoke and flames from the stacks of the steel mills showed the strength of modern-day industry, but Don and his family lived in an old-fashioned way, getting up at dawn to walk the length of their hillside fields, making sure the cows' water troughs were filled. Sometimes, a rainy day would even overfill the troughs, causing water to pool in impressions in the dirt. After a long day behind a plow or a spinning wheel, they whiled away the time at home. They took pleasure in singing while Don's wife hemmed old clothes and crocheted shawls, protecting herself from the cold.
